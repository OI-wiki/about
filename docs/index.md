The [OI (Olympiad in Informatics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiad_in_Informatics) originated in China in 1984 and is one of the top five high school subject competitions.

[ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest), organized by ICPC Foundation, is the most influential computer competition for college students.

The OI Wiki aims to be a free, open, and continuously updated site for competition programming, where you can get exciting and practical knowledge related to the competition. You can get basics, common questions, solutions, and useful tools here to help you learn the basics of competitive programming quickly and deeply.

This project is inspired by [CTF Wiki](https://ctf-wiki.org/). And we'd like to express our appreciation for all references used in this project.
